I am Ahmad Alhour, and this is my digital spot where I keep track of my various hacks, tinkers and side-projects that I have built over the years, mostly for fun and rarely for profit.

In my free time, I like to tinker on [something new](/projects), occasionally [blog](/blog), and sometimes lose myself in [recreational puzzles](https://projecteuler.net/).

You can get in touch with me via email [here](mailto:a.z.alhour@gmail.com).
