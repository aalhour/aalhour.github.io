I am Ahmad Alhour, and this is my digital spot where I keep track of my various hacks, tinkers and side-projects that I have built over the years, mostly for fun and rarely for profit. You may want to [get to know me better](/about).

In my free time, I like to tinker on [something new](/projects), occasionally [blog](/blog), and sometimes lose myself in [recreational puzzles](https://projecteuler.net/).
