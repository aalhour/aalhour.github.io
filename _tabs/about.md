I am Ahmad Alhour, a Staff Software Engineer at Grafana Labs. This is my digital spot where I write about software, books, philosophy, and whatever else I'm currently curious about. I also publish various hacks, tinkers, and side projects I've built over the years—mostly for fun, and rarely for profit.

In my free time, I like to tinker on [something new](/projects/), occasionally [blog](/), and sometimes lose myself in [recreational puzzles](https://projecteuler.net/).

**Find me:** [GitHub](https://github.com/aalhour), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aalhour), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/aalhour). Or subscribe to the blog: [RSS](/feed.xml).
