  description: "I was inspired by Tom Stuart's talk [\"Hello, declarative world!\" in 2015](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/declarative-programming/) about declarative programming as an idea, and decided to play more with μKanren in Python 3.<br/><br/>μKanren (micro-(and mini-)Kanren) refers to a family of embedded Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for relational-declarative logic programming. This is an object-oriented implementation of μKanren for Python, using Python 3 as the host language."

These courses, coupled with topics from computer design and architecture all the way to the software layer, are a joy to learn."
