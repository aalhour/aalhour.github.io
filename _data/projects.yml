# Ordering (render order)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Projects page intentionally does **no sorting**; it renders projects in the
# order they appear in this file.
#
# Order rules (stable, explicit):
# - Active projects first:
#   - owned projects
#   - then upstream contributions/collaborations
# - Previous work last:
#   - owned projects
#   - then contributions/collaborations
