	<p>Software Engineer living and working in Athens, Greece. Engaged in Full-Stack Web &amp; Desktop apps development, alongside research-and-development of the corporate's infrastructure applications. One of my main responsibilities is to develop enterprise software which replace the current commercial ones, as part of cutting the costs on <abbr title="Information Systems Department">ISD</abbr>'s budget, and increasing the flexibility of rolling-out new features as the corporate sees fit. I'm also engaged in implementing the corporate's <em>Go Green</em> movement by developing workflows and software - web, mobile and desktop - for accessing, organizing, and publishing data without relying on hard-copies (i.e. paper).</p>
