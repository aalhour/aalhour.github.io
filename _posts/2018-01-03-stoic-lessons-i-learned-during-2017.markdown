0. The three Stoic tenets: a) perception, b) directed action, c) will.

1. What's in my control, and what is not?

2. Direct your action towards what matters.

3. Be ruthless to the stuff that doesn't matter.

4. Willingness to accept the things we cannot control nor change.

5. Don't concern yourself with what doesn't matter, what is outside your control and what you cannot change.

6. Focus on the space between the stimulus and the response. There lies your choice. There lies your growth. There lies your freedom.

7. The more things we desire and the more we have to do to earn or attain those achievements, the less we actually enjoy our lives—and the less free we are.

8. The three areas of training: a) desires & aversions, b) impulses to act & impulses not to act, and the broad range of duty, c) freedom from deception and composure, and the broad range of judgment. Desires and aversions control our impulses and actions in the same
way judgment does. Judge according to logic and reason, desire what is right and good and act on what is good, right and just.

9. Study your role model of wisdom.

10. Keep it simple, cast away feelings and thoughts of worry, concern, frustration, anxiety and procrastination. Do the job. Focus on what's in front of you right here, right now. Do the task at hand as if it is the last one. There is a great deal of free time to be gained once we stop wasting time worrying!

11. “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” — Marcus Aurelius. The obstacle really is the way. See it become the way!

12. The event is not your impression of it. The territory is not your map of it. What actually happened (descriptive/factual) is not how you feel about it.

13. Watch your automatic thoughts, how do they happen? Why do they happen? Are they right, logical, rational and just? Or do they happen because you have never stopped to think about them?

14. You don't have to stay on top of everything. You don't have to know everything.

15. How much more time, energy, and pure brainpower would you have available if you drastically cut your media consumption?

16. Don't give way to anger or rage. A calm mind is a sign of strength. Try to remember that when you find yourself getting mad. Anger is not impressive or tough—it’s a mistake. It’s weakness.

17. Strength is the ability to maintain a hold of oneself. It’s being the person who never gets mad, who cannot be rattled, because they are in control of their passions—rather than controlled by their passions.

18. Establish a proper frame of mind. Control your passions. Control your impulses. Accept the present and what we cannot change. Embrace your choices. Keep a calm mind and act wisely.

19. We get anxious because we want something outside of our control. When getting anxious, ask yourself: Why are my insides twisted into knots? Am I in control here or is my anxiety? And most important: Is my anxiety doing me any good?

20. “Who then is invincible? The one who cannot be upset by anything outside their reasoned choice.”

21. If you are in the middle of a freak out or a moment of rage, just ask yourself: "Is this making me feel better? Is this actually relieving any of the symptoms I wish were gone?".

22. Practice having no opinion on things. Practice the ability of having absolutely no thoughts about something - act as if you had no idea it ever occurred.

23. Locate that yearning for more, better, someday and see it for what it is: the enemy of your contentment. Choose it or your happiness. As Epictetus says, the two are not compatible.

24. "To want nothing makes one invincible—because nothing lies outside your control."

25. Circumstances are incapable of considering or caring for your feelings, your anxiety, or your excitement. They don’t care about your reaction. They are not people.

26. We should enjoy this brief time we have on earth—not be enslaved to emotions that make us miserable and dissatisfied.

27. Remember that the tools and aims of our training are unaffected by the turbulence of the moment. Stop. Regain your composure. It’s waiting for you.

28. Empty your cup before powering more water into it. Clear your mind before seeking wisdom. Let go of pleasures before seeking new ones. Ask, do I really need this thing? Do I really need this new item? Clear your mind, empty your schedule and say no the stuff that don't matter.

29. On possessions. ask yourself: Do I need this? Is it superfluous? What’s this actually worth? What is it costing me? Nothing comes for free.

30. Don't brag and spread narratives about yourself. Say what is necessary. Listen and connect with people, don't perform for them.

31. “Slavery resides under marble and gold.” Too many successful people are prisoners in jails of their own making. Is that what you want? Is that what you’re working hard toward?

32. “Today I escaped from the crush of circumstances, or better put, I threw them out, for the crush wasn’t from outside me but in my own assumptions.” — MARCUS AURELIUS

33. Remember, each individual has a choice. You are always the one in control.

34. You are the product of your training.

35. Your mind changes depending on the thoughts and beliefs that color it, just like when you sit on a desk for a living your pelvis changes and when you wear tight shoes your feet change in adaptation to it.

36. On testing our impressions: “From the very beginning, make it your practice to say to every harsh impression, ‘you are an impression and not at all what you appear to be.’ Next, examine and test it by the rules you possess, the first and greatest of which is this—whether it belongs to the things in our control or not in our control, and if the latter, be prepared to respond, ‘It is nothing to me.’” — Epictitus, The Enchiridion

37. Judgments are the results of our attachment to opinions. If we want to feel less upset and angrey then how about we kick opinions out of our lives and just see things as they... are?

38. Always pay attention, and reflect on, your sphere of impulses, what causes them? What triggers them?

39. Do the things that happen to me help or harm me? It all depends, say the Stoics, on my values. They would go on to remind me that my values are things over which I have complete control. Therefore, if something external harms me, it is my own fault: I should have adopted different values.
