1. The three Stoic tenets: a) perception, b) directed action, c) will.

2. What's in my control, and what is not?

3. Direct your action towards what matters.

4. Be ruthless to the stuff that doesn't matter.

5. Willingness to accept the things we cannot control nor change.

6. Don't concern yourself with what doesn't matter, what is outside your control and what you cannot change.

7. Focus on the space between the stimulus and the response. There lies your choice. There lies your growth. There lies your freedom.

8. The more things we desire and the more we have to do to earn or attain those achievements, the less we actually enjoy our lives—and the less free we are.

9. The three areas of training: a) desires & aversions, b) impulses to act & impulses not to act, and the broad range of duty, c) freedom from deception and composure, and the broad range of judgment. Desires and aversions control our impulses and actions in the same
way judgment does. Judge according to logic and reason, desire what is right and good and act on what is good, right and just.

10. Study your role model of wisdom.

11. Keep it simple, cast away feelings and thoughts of worry, concern, frustration, anxiety and procrastination. Do the job. Focus on what's in front of you right here, right now. Do the task at hand as if it is the last one. There is a great deal of free time to be gained once we stop wasting time worrying!

12. “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” — Marcus Aurelius. The obstacle really is the way. See it become the way!

13. The event is not your impression of it. The territory is not your map of it. What actually happened (descriptive/factual) is not how you feel about it.

14. Watch your automatic thoughts, how do they happen? Why do they happen? Are they right, logical, rational and just? Or do they happen because you have never stopped to think about them?

15. You don't have to stay on top of everything. You don't have to know everything.

16. How much more time, energy, and pure brainpower would you have available if you drastically cut your media consumption?

17. Don't give way to anger or rage. A calm mind is a sign of strength. Try to remember that when you find yourself getting mad. Anger is not impressive or tough—it’s a mistake. It’s weakness.

18. Strength is the ability to maintain a hold of oneself. It’s being the person who never gets mad, who cannot be rattled, because they are in control of their passions—rather than controlled by their passions.

19. Establish a proper frame of mind. Control your passions. Control your impulses. Accept the present and what we cannot change. Embrace your choices. Keep a calm mind and act wisely.

20. We get anxious because we want something outside of our control. When getting anxious, ask yourself: Why are my insides twisted into knots? Am I in control here or is my anxiety? And most important: Is my anxiety doing me any good?
